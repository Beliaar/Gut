### What is this repository for? ###
Utility for adding test cases to a Godot project.  The premise is that the gut.gd script will run other scripts that contain tests.  You must manually invoke the tests by telling it to run a specific script.  Also, that script must inherit from the subclass in gut.gd.  Other than it being a kind of manual process it isn't that bad.  This project illustrates using it as well as the files needed to run it.  The files required are in the /bitwes_tools/scripts directory.  They are placed there to avoid any name conflicts with any existing scripts.  This could have been a mistake though.  We shall see.
