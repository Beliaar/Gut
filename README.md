### Godot 3.0 Compatible.
Version 6.0.0 is Godot 3.0 compatible.  These changes are not compatible with any of the 2.x versions of Godot.  The godot_2x branch has been created to hold the old version of Gut that works with Godot 2.x.  Barring any severe issues, there will not be any more development for Godot 2.x.
